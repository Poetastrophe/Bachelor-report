\section{Project management}

My main heuristic going into this project was to look for the minimal viable product, that made use of the theory of modal logic, and which was actually able to play Hanabi. So I tried to avoid premature optimizations in most places, except for parts I knew beforehand would be critical (like generating lots of possible worlds, and a compact representation for the worlds). 

I used git throughout the project as source-control, which also has the added benefit of keeping a log of the different commits, so that I could write notes there as I complete the product.
