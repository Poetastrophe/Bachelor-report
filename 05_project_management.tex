\todo[inline]{Maybe I do not need any chapter on project management}
My main heuristic was to look for the minimal viable product, that made use of the theory of modal logic, and which was actually able to play Hanabi. So I tried to avoid premature optimizations in most places, except for parts I knew beforehand would be critical (like generating lots of possible worlds, and their respective sizes). Of course there are some aspects that proved to take most of the time

I used git throughout the project as source-control, which also has the added benefit of keeping a log of the different commits, so that I could write notes there as I complete the product.
