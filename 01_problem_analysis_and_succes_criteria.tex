\section{Problem analysis}
\todo{
\begin{itemize}
\item Coarse problem analysis Describing the problem and goals in more
detail, briefly analysing the challenges, pointing out possible solutions.
\item Problem specification and analysis Detailed specification of the
problem (and goals). This might need to introduce new notation in order
to arrive at a precise description. If relevant, make state-of-the-art
solutions precise and compare.
\item Goals and success criteria Describe the goals and when a goal is
reached.
\end{itemize}
